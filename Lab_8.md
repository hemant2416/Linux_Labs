Conclusion:
Shell scripting is a powerful tool for automating tasks in Linux. In this session, we created:

System Information Script (sys_info.sh) → Fetches and displays essential system details like hostname, OS, kernel version, CPU info, RAM, and disk usage.
Basic Calculator Script (calculator.sh) → Takes user input and performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
