Experiment1

Question:
Use the touch command to create sets of empty practice files 
to use during this lab. In each set, replace X with the numbers 
1 through 6. Create six files with names of the form 
songX.mp3, snapX.jpg, filmX.avi. Create three subdirectories 
for organizing your files, and name the 
subdirectories friends, family, and work. Use a single 
command to create all three subdirectories at the same time.


Step1:
Creating Multiple Files
The touch command with brace expansion is used to create multiple files efficiently.

Step2:
Creating Multiple Directories
The mkdir command is used to create multiple directories in one go.

Step3:
Verifying Created Files and Directories
The ls command is used to list the created files and directories.
